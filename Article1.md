**Generally**

Tech is a journey; one that requires effort and consistency.
I have been inspired by Ernest to document this journey.
I feel like i m starting out ‘cause the methods I’ve been using in the past haven’t been straightforward; also I lack consistency. 
Being in an environment that makes you standout as the best with nothing challenging or inspiring is hell; definitely not fun. 
As sb who wants to change patterns and make a difference; Im going out- not just out of my way but also patterns. 
In this journey Im deactivating my socials definitely not all.
the target is to:
              reduce screen time to 3 hrs a day;
              2 workout sessions a day;
              Continuous learning;
              Finish any pending classes I had signed up for; 
              Do things publicly not just to be seen but for accountability;
What I think is that It’s ok to disappear and realign until things start to be ok;

**THOUGHTS ON AI**

Letting AI be in control is shitty and the worst thing we are doing as a generation. 
Over-reliance makes us dumb and lowers our memory. 
So I want to start like AI tools don’t exist anymore and see how Im gonna be. Oh well, how hard can that be? Let us find out!
And hey, I don't aim to discoourage anyone whose workflow has improved by use AI. 
I'd say the use of AI has been addictive, more like a drug and I aim to conquer my addiction as AI has become my search engine, my advisor, therapist and what have you. But I've opted to use it as my very last option. 
Some study I reead few days ago reported on the dangers of over relying on AI. It is a good tool, just when used right.
I almost forgot; the topic on AI replacing humans;- my opinion:From the definition of AI, it typicaly mimics human beahviour so the Turing Test can't pass anytime soon. 
The only problem we've got is people are so dependant of AI they can barely construct a sentence of their own and there you have it.
AI is intelligent than its users; and thats what I don't want.
Funny thing; I will be among the few with good non corrupted brains. It ain't funny btw. Also remember this quote:
_Our technology, our machines are part of our humanity. We create them to extend ourselves and that is what is unique about human beings.
Ray Kurzweil, Forbes Magazine_

Finally, let me not tire thee.
Technology is vast and has several fields; join me as I explore all and find what it is that I like. 
I’m Scared? As humanly as you’d imagine, I am. 
But you know what’s important ?Consistency. Showing up everyday like my life depends on in cause it literally does. 
So hey; keep watch. Hope to be back ASAP
